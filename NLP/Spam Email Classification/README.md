# ✉️ Spam Classification of Emails

## 📌 Overview
This project builds a machine learning model to classify emails as spam or not spam using NLP and classification algorithms. The dataset consists of 5,728 emails, labeled accordingly. The goal is to filter unwanted messages and improve email security.

## 🔍 Problem Statement
Spam emails account for a large portion of online threats, including phishing attacks and fraud. This project develops a spam detection model that helps email systems filter out spam messages efficiently.

## 📊 Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering
### Text Cleaning:
  * ✔ Removed subject line prefixes (e.g., "Subject: ")
  * ✔ Removed punctuation, numbers, and special characters
  * ✔ Applied stemming to reduce words to their root forms

### Feature Engineering:
✔ TF-IDF Vectorization: Converted emails into numerical data
✔ Class Imbalance Handling: Used SMOTE to balance spam vs. non-spam samples

### 🏆 Machine Learning Models & Cross-Validation Performance

|  Model                           |  Accuracy (%)  |
|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|
|Logistic Regression              | 98.60%
| Support Vector Machine (SVM)    |  98.69% 

✅ Best Model: SVM (98.7%)
