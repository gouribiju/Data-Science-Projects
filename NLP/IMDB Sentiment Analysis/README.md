# 🎭 IMDB Movie Review Sentiment Analysis

## 📌 Overview
This project applies Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to classify IMDB movie reviews as positive or negative. The dataset contains 50,000 reviews, equally balanced between both sentiments. Machine Learning models analyze text features to determine the sentiment of each review.

## 🔍 Problem Statement
Movie reviews influence audience decisions and box office performance. This project builds a sentiment analysis model that predicts whether a review expresses positive or negative feedback, helping businesses and viewers analyze public opinion.

## 📊 Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering
### Text Cleaning:
- ✔ Converted text to lowercase
- ✔ Removed punctuation, special characters, and numbers
- ✔ Eliminated stopwords (e.g., "the", "is", "and")
- ✔ Applied stemming to reduce words to their root forms

### Feature Engineering:
- ✔ TF-IDF Vectorization: Extracted important words & phrases
- ✔ Label Encoding: Converted sentiment labels to binary values (positive = 1, negative = 0)
