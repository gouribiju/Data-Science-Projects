# 🧠 Alzheimer MRI Classification

## 📌 Overview
This project classifies Alzheimer’s disease stages from MRI brain scans using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The model detects four categories:
    * Mild Impairment
    * Moderate Impairment
    * No Impairment (Healthy Brain)
    * Very Mild Impairment

## 🔍 Problem Statement
Early diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease is crucial for treatment and patient care. This deep learning model helps in automated classification of MRI scans, reducing human error and improving diagnostic efficiency.

## 📊 Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering
  * Converted images to grayscale using OpenCV.
  * Resized images to 100x100 pixels for uniformity.
  * Normalized pixel values to improve model efficiency.
  * Encoded class labels using Label Encoding.
  * Train-Test Split: 80% training, 20% testing (10,240 images total).
